{"name":"Rotationwatcher.apk","tagline":"Small CLI app for tracking Android rotation changes in real time.","body":"# RotationWatcher.apk\r\n\r\nRotationWatcher is a simple command-line application for detecting rotation changes on Android. While fairly useless by itself, it can be used together with other components such as [minicap](https://github.com/openstf/minicap) for screen capturing.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Supports Android 2.3.3+\r\n* Directly runnable as a command line application via adb shell\r\n* Tracks and outputs current rotation in degrees to stdout\r\n\r\n## Building\r\n\r\nBuild with `./gradlew assembleDebug`.\r\n\r\n## Running\r\n\r\nLike mentioned earlier, RotationWatcher is a command line application. It does not have a launcher activity, or any activity for that matter. To run the application and read its output, the following steps must be performed:\r\n\r\n1. Build the project. See above.\r\n2. Choose a module based on your platform. While the mobile module should run on most platforms as-is, wear and tv versions are also provided just in case.\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    cd mobile\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n3. Install the application.\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    adb install ./build/outputs/apk/*-debug.apk\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n4. Figure out where the application was installed. Note that the location can and will change between every install, so always rerun this after installing.\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    apk_path=$(adb shell pm path jp.co.cyberagent.stf.rotationwatcher | tr -d '\\r' | cut -d: -f 2)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n5. Run the application. Note that there's only ONE COMMAND to run, both the export and the exec run inside the device (the semicolon is escaped). The `export CLASSPATH` is required for app_process to do its magic.\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    adb shell export CLASSPATH=\"$apk_path\"\\; \\\r\n    exec app_process /system/bin jp.co.cyberagent.stf.rotationwatcher.RotationWatcher\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you may use the `./run.sh` script in each module to do the same.\r\n\r\n## Good to know\r\n\r\nThis application requires access to some private and/or hidden APIs. See [shim/README.md](shim/README.md) for details.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nSee [LICENSE](LICENSE).\r\n\r\nCopyright Â© CyberAgent, Inc.
